The Hackers of Catron
=====================

Microcontroller Target
----------------------

The microcontroller we selected is an [Atmel AT32UC3B064](http://www.atmel.com/devices/at32uc3b064.aspx). As such, this code is written with Atmel Studio, which is a modified version of Visual Studio. It contains a bunch of what appear to be extranious files that are, in fact, required for a Visual Studio project.

Microcontroller Code
--------------------

The main micro code is in the micro/Catan/Catan/src directory. The filenames are fairly descriptive, but just for completeness, they are as follows:

* BoardGen.c and BoardGen.h contain the functions to generate a Catan game board.
* Catan.c and Catan.h contain the main game functionality.
* I2C.c and I2C.h contain the functions to communicate via I2C. The microcontroller acts as an EEPROM slave to the Raspberry Pi.
* RGB.c and RGB.h contain the functions to run the RGB LEDs.
* RarityDisplay.c and RarityDisplay.h contain the functions to display numbers and characters on the 7 segment displays
* asf.h can be mostly ignored, as it was generated by Atmel Studio to include the used peripherals.
* main.c contains the main function along with functions that don't fit in elsewhere.
* The config directory contains files that set constants and basic function declerations and the like for the board.
* The asf directory can be mostly ignored, as it contains the functions required to use the peripherals, and is all generated by Atmel Studio.
